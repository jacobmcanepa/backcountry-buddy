# Backcountry-buddy
The purpose of this project was to work collaborately with others applying our knowledge in using Git and our web development skills by using HTML, CSS, and JS to create a website. This web application allows user to search via origin point (City) and the application will return 10 results of campsites in a 200 mile vicinity of the origin point. And it will also display temperature of the input origin point and display campsites on the map when clicking on campsite results.

### Summary
* APIs were used in styling and grabbing all information needed to make the web application work
* HTML was used conservatively so that we may exercise our skills in JS and CSS
* CSS was used to style colors and fonts

### Features
* Get 10 campsites near origin point of search input
